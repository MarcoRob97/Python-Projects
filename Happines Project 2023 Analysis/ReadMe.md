This project conducts an extensive analysis of the World Happiness Report, exploring trends and insights 
from the annual reports. The analysis is divided into several steps, each focusing on different aspects of 
the data to derive meaningful conclusions about global happiness.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the Data

In this initial phase, the focus is on gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. This includes exploring the structure, data types, and key features.

### Step 2: Prepare the Data

#### - Check for Duplicates
Identify and handle any duplicate entries in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

#### - Drop Irrelevant Columns
Remove columns that are not pertinent to the analysis to streamline the dataset.

#### - Create New Ranking Columns
Introduce new columns to rank the dataset based on specific criteria, providing additional insights into the happiness scores.

#### - Rename Columns
Enhance readability and clarity by renaming columns to more meaningful and consistent names.

#### - Check and Fix Null Values
Address missing values by either imputing them or removing entries with incomplete information.

### Step 3: Analyze and Visualize Results

#### - Top and Bottom Happiest Countries
Identify and showcase the countries with the highest and lowest happiness scores.

#### - Boxplots by Region and Sub-Regions
Visualize the distribution of happiness scores through boxplots, providing insights into regional variations.

#### - Sunburst Analysis
Create a sunburst chart using mean happiness scores, offering a comprehensive overview of happiness patterns.
